This is my submission for Homework 1:

- Parts 1 and 2 are in a file labeled `wgf2104_analysis.pdf` in the top-level folder along with my cgt file, `chrm-bkmk.cgt`.
- Part 3 is located in the subfolder `geotweet` and can be run by opening the file `index.html` in the browser.

###Part 3:

- date search and geographic search are implemented.

	That means queries can be performed by providing:
	- Search `keywords` and `since` *and* `until` dates
	- Search `keywords`, `Location`, and `since` *and* `until` dates

- 50 tweets are returned and the user is informed of an unreturned query as necessary.
- User credentials and search terms are noted in a well at the top of the results section of the page.
- The design was focused around simplicity and readability/navigability. The search form and app purpose and description/instructions are presented clearly and immediately.
- Equally clearly presented is a simple and intuitive search form: a datepicker and simplified format are offered, using js components and placeholders, respectively.
